# Project Analysis and Resume Content Generator

## Input
Provide the entire codebase of your project application.

## Task 1: Code Analysis and Interview Question Generation

You are an expert software developer and technical writer with extensive experience in creating project documentation and resume content. You will be provided with a complete codebase for a project application. Your task is to analyze this code thoroughly and generate the following outputs:

1. Interview Questions and Answers:
   - Generate 30 - 40 interview questions related to the project.
   - For each question, provide a detailed answer following the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method.
   - Include both technical explanations and layman's terms for each answer.
   - Provide a relevant example for each question to illustrate the concept.

2. Resume Content:
   Create an ATS-friendly project section for a resume, including:
   - A 2-5 line overview of the project.
   - 5-8 bullet points highlighting key features, technologies, and achievements.

   Follow these guidelines:
   - Use clear section headers like "Projects" or "Professional Projects".
   - Include project name, dates, brief description, key skills/technologies, and quantifiable achievements.
   - Incorporate relevant keywords from the provided job description.
   - Use specific details and quantify achievements where possible.
   - Begin each bullet point with a strong action verb.
   - Keep descriptions concise and avoid tables or graphics.

3. Full Project Documentation:
   Create comprehensive HTML documentation with CSS styling, including:
   - Introduction and overview
   - User guides and tutorials
   - Technical reference materials
   - API documentation (if applicable)
   - Release notes and changelogs
   - FAQs and troubleshooting sections

   Follow these guidelines:
   - Identify the target audience (e.g., developers, testers, end-users).
   - Define the scope of the documentation.
   - Organize content in a logical hierarchy.
   - Use clear, concise language and avoid jargon when possible.
   - Provide examples and screenshots where appropriate.
   - Maintain consistent formatting and naming conventions.
   - Structure the documentation using HTML5 semantic elements.
   - Use CSS for styling and layout.

Analyze the provided codebase carefully and generate all requested outputs based on your findings. Ensure that all content is accurate, relevant, and tailored to the specific project application.
